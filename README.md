## Hi There 👋 A-suozhang Here

My name is Tianchen Zhao and I am a grad student at BUAA.
Currently I'm a visiting student at [NICS-EFC](http://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Also as an intern at [Novauto](https://www.novauto.com.cn/) Inc.

## ⛏I'm Currently Working On

* Neural Architecture Search

I'm currently working on neural architecture search for more efficient NN model and help developing an open-source modularized NAS framework [aw-nas](https://github.com/walkerning/aw_nas).

* Efficient Deep Learning 

Aside from NAS, I also worked on other network slimming methods such as quantization / pruning. 

## 📗 My Blog

* I build my personal blog with github pages at [a-suozhang.xyz](a-suozhang.xyz), here contains some random notes I take everyday, and also some of my amateur photographs.
